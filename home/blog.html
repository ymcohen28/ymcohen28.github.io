Hi! I am  YMCohen, and this is my webpage. I am not very good at coding, and just getting used GitHub. I was confused at first about how to make a website, but I did it! Either way, you can contact me by using the 'thingy' at the bottom. I'll start writing more, don't worry. Kind of. 
  </p>
      
<p class="body1" id = "log2" >
Log number 2! This time, I am trying to make sure the css is good. And I'm trying to link the header, but whatever. Maybe soon I will do some more JS animation. <br> Hey! Guess what! there are apparently a few other Y. M. Cohen's out there, with real businesses, so I hope I don't get into a lawsuit with this. Whatever. Who cares?</p>
<p class="body1" id = "log3">
Log number 3; Day number 3! This is the third day that my website is up and running. Woo Hoo! <br>
So, today I've worked a bit on the styling (I want it to look nice), and I've worked on adding my new <strong><a href="/music.html">Music Page!</a></strong> I'm really proud of myself, so... Go Mee!!!! <br>
Now that I think about it, this should probably be on another page. Something like... /blog.html! Maybe later. <br> Oh, you know how annoying it is when the stylesheet takes a really LONNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG time to effect the page? It's really annoying. Like, really. <br> Come ON!!! UPDATE ALREADY!!! </p>

<p class="body1" id = "log4" >
This is number 4! Can you beleive it? Now my blogs are getting longer. We'll have to make an index, and set it up properly. <br> if you want to see my testing site, go to <a href = "/test.html"> https://ymcohen28.github.io/test.html</a>. That's where I'm testing out the audio options. I wnat to make it easier to modify with JS. And that brings me to my second announcement: Drumroll, please....<br> I have added JS to my website. If you don't see anything, then good for you, because I didn't use it for anything, I just tested it. Oh, and I did learn, for those of you who are wondering. (If you're wondering who's wondering, then... Whatever. <br> Shout out to my great classmates, who are probably the only ones reading My Most Wacko Website.)
    </p>

  July 18<sup>th</sup>! <br> I haven't written for a few days, as I was busy, y'know, with the fast, shabbos, and all that. The fast wasn't too hard, but it was a bit hot, and on Tuesday, tommorow, it will be <strong><em>BOILING!!! LIkE, 36Â° C! THAT IS CRAZY HOT!!!!</em></strong><br> Whatever. (Did you notice that I like using 'whatever' a lot? Who cares. Whatever. (Oh, did you notice that I also use 'who cares' a lot? whatever)). <br> So, after a while, it will probably be hard to think of things to write about, but <em> whatever</em>. (Hah!!) <br> Either way, the JS is not loading on my test page, and that is really really really really annoying, so I'll just have to figure it out. If you know how to help me, send me a chat. (I still have to figure out how to make it that it won't be live, only if I want to. <em> Whatever </em>). 
    </p>
    <p class="body1" id = "log6" >
  July 26<sup>th</sup>! <br> I haven't written for a few days, as I was busy, y'know, (did you notice how I copied an pasted from the other blog? Heh! <em>Whatever</em>.)<br>Basically, I have managed to add internal JS properly, and I tested it by making it replace the header html of the test. I also managed to add inline HTML, and I tested that by making it replace the header of the index, which just updated now, so if the navigation says "This is Hacked!!", don't worry!!<br> I will try some more cool things with this, but for some reason, the <span class = "code">audio.currentTime</span> didn't work, so I have to figure that one out. We'll add some more pages in later. Maybe. <br> Oh, I forgot to mention that I finished school today! Yayyyyyyyyyyyyy! Either way, I have more time. Oh, I should have said <em> whatever</em>. Oh,<em> whatever </em>. Point is,I'll be able to add some more to the website over the next few weeks. Bye Bye for now!!
    </p>
    <p class="body1" id = "log7" >
  July 27<sup>th</sup>! <br> I have managed to move over the blog to this new page, and... drumroll, please, I have set up a redirector on <a href = "/index.html">the home page</a> that actually cancels the redirector when you click... (At least the way it works on my computer, but it might be biased...) and it changes the text when you click to prevent it, or when the timer is up... I haven't figured out which thing it does. <em>Whatever.</em> Either way, I hope to add a blog menu, and style it properly. I don't have a lot to write about, so I'll end off for now. 
    </p>
  <p class="body1" id = "log8" >
  Oct 4<sup>th</sup>! <br> I haven't written in a longgggggg time! I don't have much to write; I'm working on some styling, but I can't say much. It's the holiest day of the year tommorrow, so I should probably preapre. <em> Whatever.</em> (See, I remembered that even now!) <br> On a side note, can you imagine that today, I held a few <em> LIVE CHICKENS!!! </em> (I know, I had to add the <span class = "code">'em'</span>tag.)
